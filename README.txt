The Noise_in_Leuven folder conatins two sub folders, one contains datasets. 
The dataset folder has two files, one containing metadata about the weather stations, ie: their locations, (This is only useful for the folium map), and the Sound_weather dataset. 
The Sound_weather dataset is the datasetmerging tall the information we could gather. The models are run into that dataset. 

The other folder contains 4 files (excluding this one). One is the jupyter notebook containg my code. One, Latvia_app is the begining of a streamlit app I made. utils.py is the file containing
custom functions I used (it makes the code slightly neater), make sure to keep that file in the same folder as the notebook. If you run your notebook online, just copy paste it at the begining 
of the code. It should work. The last file, requirement.txt contains the packages used in the projects that you will have to add to your environment. 

To run the code you should: 
-Instal lthe required packages 
-Define the functions 
-Specify all the required folders and files path. 

And then, hopefully, it should run.
